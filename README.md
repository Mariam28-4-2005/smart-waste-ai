## 💬 Prompt Summary
**Problem:**  
Households often struggle to properly sort their waste into the correct recycling categories (plastic, paper, glass, metal). This causes mixed waste, contamination, and inefficiency in recycling systems.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Develop a smart waste management app that uses AI and computer vision to classify waste in real time using the phone’s camera. The app tells the user which bin to use (e.g., plastic, paper, glass, metal) and rewards correct sorting with points or badges.

**AI Role:**  
The AI model performs real-time image classification and improves over time with user feedback. Optional features include:
- Showing nearby recycling centers  
- Providing environmental tips  
- Tracking personal recycling statistics  

**Expected Impact:**  
- Higher recycling rates and awareness  
- Reduced landfill waste  
- Stronger community engagement in sustainability efforts
