# EcoSort – Smart AI Waste Management App ♻️

A mobile/web app that uses **AI** and **computer vision** to identify the type of waste (plastic, paper, glass, metal) through the phone’s camera.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
- The user takes a photo of an item.
- The AI classifies the waste and shows the correct recycling bin.
- Users earn points for correct sorting.
- Optional: View nearby recycling centers or get eco tips.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Generated using:** Google AI Studio & ChatGPT 5.0  
- **Frontend:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- **AI Model:** Image classification (vision-based)  
- **Code Editing:** Fully AI-generated (no manual edits)

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
Encourage sustainable habits and increase recycling efficiency by helping people correctly sort their waste using AI.

---

## 💬 Prompt Summary
**Problem:**  
Households often struggle to properly sort their waste into the correct recycling categories (plastic, paper, glass, metal). This causes mixed waste, contamination, and inefficiency in recycling systems.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Develop a smart waste management app that uses AI and computer vision to classify waste in real time using the phone’s camera. The app tells the user which bin to use (e.g., plastic, paper, glass, metal) and rewards correct sorting with points or badges.

**AI Role:**  
The AI model performs real-time image classification and improves over time with user feedback. Optional features include:
- Showing nearby recycling centers  
- Providing environmental tips  
- Tracking personal recycling statistics  

**Expected Impact:**  
- Higher recycling rates and awareness  
- Reduced landfill waste  
- Stronger community engagement in sustainability efforts

history chat with GhatGPT
---I want to create an AI app that helps people recycle correctly.
Many households don’t sort their waste properly — plastic, paper, glass, or metal — and that causes contamination and less recycling efficiency.
The app will use the phone’s camera to detect the waste type and tell the user which bin to use. It can also give points or badges for correct sorting.
Can you write me a prompt for this idea to use in Google AI Studio?

--Here’s an initial version of your prompt 👇

AI Problem:
People often mix different types of household waste, leading to recycling issues.

Proposed Solution:
Build an app that uses AI and the phone camera to recognize trash type and tell users where to throw it. It can also include fun features like a score or badges.

AI Role:
The AI classifies images and shows which category it belongs to.

---I like it, but I want to make it more detailed — like I’ll mention that the AI should learn from feedback and show nearby recycling centers.

--Great edit! Here’s the improved version of your prompt, rewritten to be clear, structured, and ready for Google AI Studio 👇
